Swift - League of Legends Buff Timers
============================

My first pretty simple app made with Swift.
Decided to try out work with UI elements and NSTimers.

### How To Use It
1. Click on buff icon to start the timer
2. Button will became disabled untill timer hits the zero mark
3. When timer ends up you'll see SPAWNED message and button will become enabled again
